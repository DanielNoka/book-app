ðŸ“š Book App
This project is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing books, authors, categories, and user authentication. It includes essential features such as:

- CRUD operations for books, authors, and categories.

- Pagination, filtering, and sorting for efficient data retrieval.

- JWT authentication and role-based security (USER can read, update, and post; ADMIN can also delete).

- Swagger UI for easy API documentation access.

- Mail service for email notifications (e.g., new book registrations).

- Logging system that stores logs and errors in the database for better monitoring and debugging.

This project provides a scalable, secure, and efficient backend foundation, designed for real-world applications.
